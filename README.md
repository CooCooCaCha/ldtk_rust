# LDtk Rust Library

This library parses JSON generated by [LDtk](https://ldtk.io) for use in Rust.
LDtk is a 2d level editor for games that supports multiple tile layers, powerful
auto-tiling rules, entity placement and more.

This library parses the JSON format created by LDtk so it can be used in Rust. It
provides typed access to the values so you get safety, compiler assistance and 
auto-completion in your editor.

It should be usable in any Rust game framework.

## Status

Currently the LDtk sample files appear to load without errors, but it's early. 
Most everything is untested and types and functionality are likely to change.
Code review and more examples are welcomed.

## Getting Started

Calling the new_from_file() public function with the path to a LDtk file will
populate a struct that closely resembles the [LDtk JSON format](https://ldtk.io/json/).

```rust
extern crate ldtk_rust;

fn main() {
    let file_path = "assets/AutoLayers_1_basic.ldtk".to_string();
    let ldtk = ldtk_rust::new_from_file(file_path);
    println!("First level pixel height is {}!", ldtk.levels[0].px_hei);
}
```

## Using with [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/)

An example running in Bevy 0.4 is included in the [examples](examples/) directory.
In a startup system you can read in the LDtk JSON and load all the tile assets. Then
you can spawn the tiles by iterating through the levels, layer instances and finally
tiles.
