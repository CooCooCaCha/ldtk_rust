//! This library parses JSON generated by LDtk (Level Designers ToolKit) for use in Rust.
//! It is designed to be usable in any Rust program, including all game frameworks.
//!
//! Here are a few ways to start:
//!
//! * type this and experiment: let ldtk = LdtkFile::new("/path/to/file.ldtk");
//! * /examples ~ check this directory for example code and [there you go | voil√† | Bob's your uncle];
//! * /README.md ~ a bit more descriptive intro with links to resources
//!
